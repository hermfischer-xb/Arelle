"""
FormulaConstraints.py - relationship constraints as static expressions.

A relationship type may carry `constraints`, each a boolean expression in this
language over the relationship's own objects (tavi.md, relationship constraints
object; tavi-formula.md, "Static Expressions").  They are evaluated while
validating a model, once per relationship of that type.

The expression is *static*: it may reference model objects and their properties,
and it may navigate, but it may not reference reported data or anything outside
the model.  That restriction is what makes a constraint checkable at compile
time rather than a query that happens to run then, and it is enforced here
rather than left as a claim in the specification.
